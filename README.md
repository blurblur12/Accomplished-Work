# Accomplished-Work
C++ programs demonstrating applications of OOP, data abstraction, and various data structure including priority queue AVL tree, and skip lists, and LZW compression

Straights:
- a simplified straights card game implemented using object oriented programming and data abstraction, review the demo.pdf file to see functions and working features of the program

Priority queue:
- included three different implementations of the priority queue data stracture
- the first implementation used linked list, the second used max-heapd, and the third used a vector of queues
- included runtime and space analysis for each implementation
- check the description.txt file to see commands for the program

AVLSkip:
- implemented two realizations of dicionary using AVL-tree and skip list
- check description.txt file to see commands for the program
