The three implementations are numbered 1(linked-list), 2(max-heap), and 3(vector of queues).
i num priority - inserts an item (priority, timestamp) into priority queue num.

d num - removes the item with the highest priority from priority queue num and prints the priority and timestamp to stdout - the two integers are separated by a space and a newline follows the second integer. If the priority queue is empty, does nothing.
 
l num - prints (but does not remove) the item with the highest priority from priority queue num. Prints the priority and timestamp to stdout - the two integers are separated by a space and a newline follows the second integer. If the priority queue is empty, does nothing.

r - initializes or resets all priority queues to be empty.

x - terminates the program.
